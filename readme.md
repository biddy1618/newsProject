# Project "News Analysis"

## Project plan (alpha)
Part 1 - getting the data:
* Crawl news data from __inform.kz__
* * Set up a crawler to fetch the data and store in DB - later
* * * For now, simply crawl the data in a single thread
* * * Write crawler in paraller (4 threads) - later
* * * Think about efficient I/O operation for storing the crawled data - later
* Set up PostgreSQL DB for storing the links and articles - done
* * Create table for links, create table for articles

Part 2 - working over models:
* Run EDA, some ETL and build models. Candidate models:
* * Text Generation based on LSTM
* * Label prediction
* * Will see based on EDA
* Deploy the model locally
* * Set up SQL database for storing database (later)
* * Set up the server for serving the service (or website)
* Write tests
* * First tests - done
* Write logs for crawler
* * Start working on logging

The project will be run based on flask server. The server will act as a daemon for crawler fetching the web-data while computer is on.


## Crawler structure

* The try and except blocks are used to handle exceptions. The assert is used to ensure the conditions are compatible with the requirements of a function. - [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/practical-python-try-except-and-assert-7117355ccaab)
* Python’s assert statement is a debugging aid, not a mechanism for handling run-time errors. The goal of using assertions is to let developers find the likely root cause of a bug more quickly. An assertion error should never be raised unless there’s a bug in your program. - [link](https://medium.com/@jadhavmanoj/python-what-is-raise-and-assert-statement-c3908697bc62)
